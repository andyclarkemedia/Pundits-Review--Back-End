# Pundits Review Scraping Process
Development of the scraping process used to collect data for the Pundits Review website - https://www.punditsreview.com/

> Pundits Review scrapes and processes news articles about the Premier League in order to give players and teams a review score each week. Each Monday, the project collects articles, divides them into phrases, identifies the player or club being referred to and then predicts the sentiment of the phrase. See more on how it works <a href="https://www.punditsreview.com/howitworks">here</a>!

Phase One represents the first method used and final phase represents the solution eventually integrated into the Pundits Review project.
